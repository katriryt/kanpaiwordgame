# 乾杯 かんぱい - Kanpai! wordgame

## Application Purpose

Purpose of the **乾杯 かんぱい - Kanpai wordgame** is to learn to read top  Japanese words in a fun and interactive way. The game covers most common Japanese words for e.g. greetings, food, and verbs.

Japanese uses three different syllabary - kanji, hiragana, and katakana (and in some cases the Latin script (known as roomaji)). The words are presented in all these versions, depending on which version is used in real life.

The game is a modified version of the standard word game, and assumes that the players do not necessarily have previous knowledge in Japanese. The player is presented with the different readings of the word and he/she needs to select the correct translation in English (or vice versa).

## User Groups
